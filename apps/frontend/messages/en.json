To start building, search for the region's Team and see how you can help them out! Many people start by building their own neighborhood or even just their own house and then they go on to build more. Don't be scared that you are not good enough to build. We all start with something small. Remember that we are there to help you learn how to build more complicated things.",

All Teams require you to \"apply\" which is aimed at teaching you the basics of building on the Earth world. This usually consists of recreating 1 or 2 small buildings on their server. You can always ask for help and building advice on our Discord server. Experienced builders are always more than willing to help you get started.",
