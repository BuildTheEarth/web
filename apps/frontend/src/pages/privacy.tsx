				<h3 id="retention-of-your-personal-data">Retention of Your Personal Data</h3>
				<p>
					BuildTheEarth will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this
					Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal
					obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our policies.
				</p>
				<p>
					If there are multiple details regarding the retention period or deletion period for a given date, the longest
					period always applies. If a period does not explicitly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it
					automatically begins at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the
					case of ongoing contractual relationships in which data is stored, the event triggering the period is the
					effective date of the termination or other termination of the legal relationship.
				</p>
				<p>
					We process data that is no longer stored for the originally intended purpose but due to legal requirements or
					other reasons only for the reasons that justify its storage.
				</p>
				<p>The following general periods apply to retention and archiving under German law:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<strong>10 years</strong> - retention period for books and records, annual financial statements,
						inventories, management reports, opening balance sheets as well as the work instructions and other
						organizational documents necessary for their understanding (Section 147 (1) No. 1 in conjunction with
						Section 3 AO, Section 14b (1) UStG, Section 257 (1) No. 1 in conjunction with Section 4 HGB)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>8 years</strong> - accounting documents, such as invoices and cost receipts (Section 147 Paragraph 1
						No. 4 and 4a in conjunction with Paragraph 3 Sentence 1 AO and Section 257 Paragraph 1 No. 4 in conjunction
						with Paragraph 4 HGB)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>6 years</strong> - Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, reproductions
						of sent commercial or business letters, other documents insofar as they are relevant for taxation, e.g.
						hourly wage slips, operating statements, calculation documents, price labels, but also payroll documents
						insofar as they are not already accounting documents and cash register slips (Section 147 (1) Nos. 2, 3, 5
						in conjunction with Section 3 AO, Section 257 (1) Nos. 2 and 3 in conjunction with Section 4 HGB)
					</li>
					<li>
						<strong>3 years</strong> - Data required to consider potential warranty and compensation claims or similar
						contractual claims and rights, as well as to process related inquiries, based on previous business
						experience and common industry practices, will be stored for the duration of the regular statutory
						limitation period of three years (Section 195, 199 BGB)
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="transfer-of-your-personal-data">Transfer of Your Personal Data</h3>
				<p>
					Your information, including Personal Data, is processed at BuildTheEarth&#39;s operating locations and in any
					other places where the parties involved in the processing are located. This means that this information may be
					transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other
					governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.
				</p>
				<p>Our servers are primarily located in Germany and may also be located in the Netherlands or United States.</p>
				<p>
					Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such information represents your agreement
					to that transfer.
				</p>
				<p>
					BuildTheEarth will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in
					accordance with this Privacy Policy and no transfer of your Personal Data will take place to an organization
					or a country unless there are adequate controls in place including the security of your data and other
					personal information.
				</p>
				<h3 id="delete-your-personal-data">Delete Your Personal Data</h3>
				<p>
					You have the right to delete or request that we assist in deleting the Personal Data that we have collected
					about you.
				</p>
				<p>Our Service may give you the ability to delete certain information about you from within the Service.</p>
				<p>
					You may update, amend, or delete your information at any time by signing in to your Account and visiting the
					account settings section that allows you to manage your personal information. You may also contact us to
					request access to, correct, or delete any personal information that you have provided to us.
				</p>
				<p>
					Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information when we have a legal obligation or lawful
					basis to do so.
				</p>
				<h3 id="disclosure-of-your-personal-data">Disclosure of Your Personal Data</h3>
				<h4 id="law-enforcement">Law enforcement</h4>
				<p>
					Under certain circumstances, BuildTheEarth may be required to disclose your Personal Data if required to do so
					by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
				</p>
				<h4 id="other-legal-requirements">Other legal requirements</h4>
				<p>BuildTheEarth may disclose your Personal Data in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Comply with a legal obligation</li>
					<li>Protect and defend the rights or property of BuildTheEarth</li>
					<li>Prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service</li>
					<li>Protect the personal safety of users of the Service or the public</li>
					<li>Protect against legal liability</li>
				</ul>
				<h3 id="security-of-your-personal-data">Security of Your Personal Data</h3>
				<p>
					In accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs
					and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of the processing as well as the different probabilities of
					occurrence and the extent of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, we take appropriate
					technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.
				</p>
				<p>
					These measures include, in particular, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by
					controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as the access, input, and transfer of data,
					ensuring its availability, and segregation. Furthermore, we have established procedures that ensure the
					exercise of data subjects' rights, the deletion of data, and responses to data threats.
				</p>
				<p>
					To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption
					technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data
					transmission on the internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or
					app and the user's browser (or between two servers), thereby protecting the data from unauthorized access.
					TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest
					security standards. If a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is signaled by the display of
					HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is being transmitted securely and
					encrypted.
				</p>
				<h3 id="user-generated-content">User-Generated Content</h3>
				<p>
					As a community project focused on creating content in Minecraft, we want to clarify the ownership of content
					created within our service:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Building Content:</strong> Any buildings, structures, or creations made in Minecraft as part of
							the BuildTheEarth project remain the intellectual property of their builders.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Screenshots and Images:</strong> Images or screenshots of these creations belong to the person who
							took the screenshot, while respecting the rights of the original builder.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							<strong>Showcase Gallery:</strong> When content is uploaded to the BuildTheEarth showcase gallery or
							Discord server channels, the copyright remains with the original creators, though you grant us license to
							display this content.
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Users can create the following content on our platform:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Accounts</li>
					<li>Applications to BuildTeams (custom to each team and reviewed by them)</li>
