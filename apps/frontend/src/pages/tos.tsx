					Our Service allows You to post Content. You are responsible for the Content that You post to the Service,
					including its legality, reliability, and appropriateness.
				</p>
				<p>
					By posting Content to the Service, You grant Us the right and license to use, modify, publicly perform,
					publicly display, reproduce, and distribute such Content on and through the Service. You retain any and all of
					Your rights to any Content You submit, post or display on or through the Service and You are responsible for

					You represent and warrant that: (i) the Content is Yours (You own it) or You have the right to use it and

					the Service does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, contract rights or any other
					rights of any person.
				</p>
				<h3 id="content-ownership">Content Ownership</h3>
				<p>
					As BuildTheEarth is a project based on creating content (&quot;Buildings&quot;) in Minecraft, content
					ownership of these buildings and any images taken of them belongs to the builders and the person taking the
					screenshots. This ownership remains in place when uploaded to the showcase gallery of BuildTheEarth or its
					Discord server channels.
				</p>
				<h3 id="content-restrictions">Content Restrictions</h3>
				<p>
					The Company is not responsible for the content of the Service&#39;s users. You expressly understand and agree

					reserves the right to make formatting and edits and change the manner of any Content. The Company can also
					limit or revoke the use of the Service if You post such objectionable Content.
				</p>
				<p>
					As the Company cannot control all content posted by users and/or third parties on the Service, you agree to
					use the Service at your own risk. You understand that by using the Service You may be exposed to content that

					being backed up or that changes during the time a backup is performed.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Company will provide support and attempt to troubleshoot any known or discovered issues that may affect
					the backups of Content. But You acknowledge that the Company has no liability related to the integrity of
					Content or the failure to successfully restore Content to a usable state.
