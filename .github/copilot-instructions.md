When creating commit messages and summaries for git, please use the conventional commit style. We set the scope to be in the format of <subrepo>/<scope> (for example: feat(api/claims)). If it is global or affefcting multiple subrepos, please use the "mono" scope.

Use the style of the code already present. We use prettier for formatting.

We use Yarn version 4 for node.js dependencies, always answer with commands for this tool.

We only write Typescript in this repository. Ignore any Javascript files and always respond with valid Typescript code.

Our team uses a github project to track issues and features.
